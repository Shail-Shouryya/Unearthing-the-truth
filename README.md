<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>
The goal of this project was to use knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage that displays data in a table by taking data initially stored in JSON format (in a .js file) and iterating through the JSON objects using a JavaScript file and creating the the index.html file as the HTML template and using CSS to streamline the formatting process.
